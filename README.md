## TennisGOAT GitHub Page
 
This repository evaluates the success of professional male tennis players in the Open Era. It also includes various other descriptive statistics and rankings of professional tennis that I find interesting. The website includes about a dozen tabs that rank and/or graph the performance of professional male tennis players. The website is currently updated through the 2024 Australian Open.

## Wrangling
This folder hosts the R scripts that I used to wrangle the data and bring it into the appropriate format.

## QMD
Each tab on the website corresponds to a qmd file on this repository. Check the repository to see the R code utilized to create this website.

## References

The website uses match and rank data acquired from [Jeff Sackmann](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) and [ultimate tennis statistics](https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com). Without these sources, I would be unable to perform this analysis.
