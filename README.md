# Tennis-GOAT
 
This repository evaluates the success of professional male tennis players in the Open Era. It also includes various other descriptive statistics and rankings of professional tennis that I find interesting.

The website uses match and rank data acquired from Jeff Sackmann (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) and ultimate tennis statistics (https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com).
